        RadiUS is a web-based application that aims to help users find various
        activities at home or within their vicinity/community. Due to covid
        people are limited to the distance they can travel until further
        restrictions are lifted. Using a RadiUs profile account, we aim to help
        filter activities based on the user's likes and interest.
